## Prova de notícia

Jo em rebel·lo started its technology development in 2007 by former Wind&Site engineers (with more than 20 years of experience), atmospheric physicists and computer experts in a unusual collaborative team of experienced professionals with active researchers. Our products have been designed after intensive dialog with the wind industry and we benefit from a users continuous feedback.

Jo em rebel·lo is a private company, owned by its members and independent of any investment fund or consultancy firm. We have developed our own technology and do not depend on third parties to modify it. At Jo em rebel·lo we are not alone: our technology is based on WRF, a state-of-the-art non-linear flow code developed through a collaborative effort by several atmospheric research centers and an active community.
