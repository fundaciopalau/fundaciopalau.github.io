#How far is your time series nearest calculation node away from my mast?

Since SERIES (like all Jo em rebel·lo products) are computed on demand, their calculation domain is centered on your selected point of interest so "distance to nearest calculation node" is always 0.

Furthermore, Jo em rebel·lo SERIES spatial resolution is 3km, currently the finest one in the market.
