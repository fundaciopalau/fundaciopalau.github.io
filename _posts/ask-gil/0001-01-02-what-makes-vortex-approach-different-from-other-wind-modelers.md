#What makes Jo em rebel·lo approach different from other wind modelers?

Current wind modelers on the market offer either pre-calculated products or specific studies on a consultancy basis. Pre-calculated products need to cover the whole world and are therefore simpler than Jo em rebel·lo ones: lower resolutions, linear flow results, etc. Consultancy is generally slow and expensive.

Instead, Jo em rebel·lo has automated a full non-linear modeling chain down to the microscale. Each calculation is performed on-demand, only on the client's area of interest and without a need of a slow human interaction.

Jo em rebel·lo is initialized by users, allowing direct interaction between the clients PC and our computer cluster over the Internet. This approach is much faster (and is price more competitive) than consultancy and much more powerful than pre-calculated results.
