#Does Jo em rebel·lo produce reliable results within a forest?

Jo em rebel·lo MAST results have been compared fairly successfully against user measurements taken inside or near a forest after certain precautions have been taken:

Jo em rebel·lo land use data comes from satellite information. Such information can distinguish between different types of trees but says nothing about the trees’ height. Depending on the forest, it is advisable to transport the calculation height down to take into account the canopy of the forest. For example, if trees are 15m high, model results at 60m will better match measurements at 45m. This kind of corrections must be performed by the client when information about the forest is available.
