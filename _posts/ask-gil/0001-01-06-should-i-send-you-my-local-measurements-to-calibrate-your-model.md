#Should I send you my local measurements to calibrate your model?

No, your measured data is your only reference to check the reliability of our modeling system. If you have good-quality, local measurements, comparing them against our short-term (1 year) product, MAST, gives you a clean measure of the model’s ability to reproduce your particular case. To be clean, such comparison is performed at your office: you never send your measured data, its us who send you our computer results.

Since the methodology used to compute all other, long-term Jo em rebel·lo wind estimations is the same as that used for MAST, you can use the accuracy of the results of the latter to estimates the accuracy of the former.
