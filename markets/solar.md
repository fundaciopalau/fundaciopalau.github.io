<p class="lead">Sun irradiation touches every site on Earth but scattered by many diffusive agents. Jo em rebelÂ·lo helps you narrowing uncertainty on site-specific solar energy resources with the best blend of ground measurements, remote sensing and atmospheric modeling technologies.</p>

##Unveiling regional resources for integrated development

**At preliminary stages, solar GHI and DNI direct for effective sites resource pre-screening** Solar Map and Site provide a complete regional assessment of available solar energy resources in a glance.

##Dynamic information for feasibility studies

**To feed yield estimation with measurements and without measurements** Solar Series spanned over twenty years at minutal sampling, just to avoid unexpected surprises over the long-term bankability.
